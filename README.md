# Seforim Finder: 

# Installation 
This repository contains files for setting up the seforim finder on a windows computer. Instructions for setting it up on a macOS or Linux computer are virtually the same, but require me to create an additional file. Create an issue if you would like instructions for setting the program up on those platforms.

Steps: 
 1. Click on the green button above labeled "Code", and click "Download as zip" to download the contents of this repository into a zip file and unzip/extract the zip file
 2. Download the Java programming language which allows the program to run, from [here](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk11/13/GPL/openjdk-11.0.1_windows-x64_bin.zip) and extract the zip file to the folder named "Scripts".
 3. Double-click the file in the Scripts folder named "SeforimFinder.bat" and the program should start up!

If you would like to add a shortcut to the taskbar at the bottom of the screen to run the program follow the steps below. If you don't care about the icon in the taskbar displaying the seforim finder logo, skip steps 2 and 3.

 1. 
 2. Go to the folder named "Shortcuts" and right click the file named "Seforim Finder - Shortcut".
 3. Click "Change icon", and find the icon in the folder named "Images".
 4. Drag the shortcut file to the taskbar and the shortcut should appear. Click on the new shortcut and the program should start up!
