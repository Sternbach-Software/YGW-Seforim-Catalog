# Seforim Finder


This is a fast, powerful, and beautiful (see screenshots below) program for searching a catalog of Hebrew books (seforim). It can search by exact match, malei/chaseir (plene/defective) insensitivity, and Root word search (good for finding a sefer with an approximate title, among other things). I would love to spread it to other yeshivos for free. if you would like to use it, please let me know so I can keep tabs on the user base. Feel free to create an issue [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/YGW-Seforim-Catalog/issues/new/choose) if you need help setting it up. The code is available [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/SeforimCatalog)

# Installation 
This repository contains files for setting up the seforim finder on a Windows computer. Instructions for setting it up on a macOS or Linux computer are virtually the same, but require me to create an additional file. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/YGW-Seforim-Catalog/issues/new/choose) if you would like instructions for setting the program up on those platforms.

### Basic installation 
 1. Download the contents of this repository into a zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/YGW-Seforim-Catalog/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (download will start automatically), and unzip/extract the zip file.
 2. Download the Java programming language which allows the program to run by clicking [here](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk11/13/GPL/openjdk-11.0.1_windows-x64_bin.zip) (download will start automatically) and extract the zip file to the main folder so that the folder with the name "jdk..." is in the same folder as the file "SeforimFinder.jar".
 3. Double-click the file named "SeforimFinderRunner.bat" (the file with a gear icon - the ".bat" part may not be visible) and the program should start up!

### Adding a taskbar shortcut

If you would like to add a shortcut to the taskbar at the bottom of the screen that can be clicked to run the program, follow the steps below. If you don't care about the icon in the taskbar displaying the seforim finder logo, skip step 4.

 1. Right-click on SeforimFinderRunner.bat (the file with a gear icon) and click "Create shortcut".
 2. Right-click the newly created file named "SeforimFinderRunner - Shortcut", and click on "Properties".
 3. In the text field with the label "Target:", replace the text with `%windir%\system32\cmd.exe /c start "" "%CD%\SeforimFinderRunner.bat"`. Click "Apply" to save the changes.
 4. Click "Change icon". In the popup, click "Browse..." and navigate to where you extracted this repository (the file you downloaded in step 1 of Basic Installation above). There is an icon in that folder with a magnifying glass on a book. Double-click that image to select it. Click "OK" to exit the icon picker popup window. Click "Apply" in the Properties windo to save the changes, and click "OK" to close the Properties window.
 5. Drag the shortcut file to the taskbar and the shortcut should appear. Click on the new shortcut and the program should start up!
