# Seforim Finder


This is a fast, powerful, and beautiful (see screenshots below) program for searching a catalog of Hebrew books (seforim). It can search by exact match, malei/chaseir (plene/defective) insensitivity, and Root word search (good for finding a sefer with an approximate title, among other things). I would love to spread it to other yeshivos for free. if you would like to use it, please let me know so I can keep tabs on the user base. Feel free to create an issue [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/YGW-Seforim-Catalog/issues/new/choose) if you need help setting it up. The code is available [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/SeforimCatalog)

# Installation 
This repository contains files for setting up the seforim finder on a Windows computer. Instructions for setting it up on a macOS or Linux computer are virtually the same, but require me to create an additional file. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/YGW-Seforim-Catalog/issues/new/choose) if you would like instructions for setting the program up on those platforms.

Steps: 
 1. Download the contents of this repository into a zip file by clicking [here](https://github.com/shmueldabomb441/YGW-Seforim-Catalog/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (download will start automatically), and unzip/extract the zip file.
 2. Download the Java programming language which allows the program to run by clicking [here](https://download.java.net/java/GA/jdk11/13/GPL/openjdk-11.0.1_windows-x64_bin.zip) (download will start automatically) and extract the zip file to the main folder so that the folder with the name "jdk..." is in the same folder as SeforimFinder.jar.
 3. Double-click the file named "SeforimFinder.bat" and the program should start up!

If you would like to add a shortcut to the taskbar at the bottom of the screen to run the program follow the steps below. If you don't care about the icon in the taskbar displaying the seforim finder logo, skip steps 2 and 3.

 1. 
 2. Go to the folder named "Shortcuts" and right click the file named "Seforim Finder - Shortcut".
 3. Click "Change icon", and find the icon in the folder named "Images".
 4. Drag the shortcut file to the taskbar and the shortcut should appear. Click on the new shortcut and the program should start up!
